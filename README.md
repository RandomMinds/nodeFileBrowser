A super simple web-based file manager written for node. Hopefully, this will be made modular so it can be dropped 
into other projects at will.

* [mmmagic](http://npmjs.org/package/mmmagic) -- v0.3.4 or newer
* [express](http://npmjs.org/package/express) -- v3.4.0 or newer
* [express3-handlebars](http://npmjs.org/package/express3-handlebars) -- v0.5.0 or newer


Install
============

    npm install


Features
============

Current:

  * Ability to change port
  * Ability to allow / ban symlinks
  * Ability to allow / ban hidden files
  * Set a custom directory.

Future:

  * Create users and manage permissions
  * Create guest accounts with access timeouts
  * Add a public folder / dropbox (can upload but cannot see files)
  * Ability to upload / delete / rename / etc..
  * Zip multiple files and download all at once
  * + more?


Use

Should be straight forward. Configure the options and port inside of app.js.
Enjoy.
